## ðŸ“– What I Learned from This Course
- Learned to implement **linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees** from scratch. 
- Explored the efficiency of **heaps and union-find structures**.
- Understood the power of **hashing for fast lookup** and **tree structures** for range queries.
- Learned how to use different data types to solve problems effectively.
- Learned how to balance between **space complexity** and **time complexity** for optimal solutions.
